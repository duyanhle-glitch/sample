## Introduction

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Project! This dataset, sourced from [Samruddhi Bhosale on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), contains two key tables that have been merged into one comprehensive dataset for analysis:

- **Orders.csv**: Contains customer details, including:
  - **Order ID** (Primary Key)
  - **Order Date**
  - **Customer Name**
  - **State**
  - **City**

- **Details.csv**: Contains order details with:
  - **Order ID** (Primary Key)
  - Details of all subsequent orders from Orders.csv

This merged dataset is instrumental for analyzing sales performance, understanding customer preferences, and making informed business decisions.

## Data Discussion

- **Sub-Category**: A more specific classification (e.g., Phones, Chairs, Trousers).
- **Payment Mode**: The method of payment used (e.g., COD, Credit Card, UPI).

### Important Columns for Analysis

- **Amount** and **Profit**: Critical for understanding financial performance.
- **Quantity**: Helps gauge product demand.
- **Category** and **Sub-Category**: Essential for market segmentation analysis.
- **Payment Mode**: Insights into customer preferences regarding transaction methods.

### Data Cleaning/Processing

Before analysis, the dataset needs to be cleaned to:
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicates
- Ensure consistent data types
- Address erroneous entries (e.g., negative profits)
